# WebAssembly: running Orin programs in Orbit

Orin compiles programs to WebAssembly modules for [Orbit](https://github.com/orin-lang/orbit), Orin's isolate runtime.
Design and measurements: [ADR-0055](decisions/0055-webassembly-target-orbit.md).

```sh
orin build --target=wasm64-orbit                   # -> build/dev/<name>.wasm (build/release/ with --release)
orin build --target=wasm32-orbit                   # the same program with a 32-bit memory
orbit inspect build/dev/hello.wasm                 # imports, exports, the capability manifest
orbit run build/dev/hello.wasm --grant log/v1 --invoke orin_main
```

Needs a clang with the WebAssembly backend and `wasm-ld`: the pinned LLVM (`orin toolchain install`) has both; on Ubuntu the
system `clang` plus the `lld` package also works (`CC=clang`).

## What the module looks like

- **wasm64** (Memory64) or **wasm32**, freestanding: no WASI, no libc imports. The only imports are Orbit capabilities the program reaches:
  `orbit:log/v1` (console output, trap messages) and `orbit:clock/v1` (time).
- **Exports:** `memory`; `orin_main() -> i32` runs `main` and returns the exit status; `orin_exit_status() -> i32` gives the
  status passed to `exit` after a trap (101 for an Orin trap such as an out-of-bounds index), or -1 for any other trap.
- **Manifest:** a custom section `orbit.manifest`, e.g. `{"abi":1,"requires":["log/v1"],"producer":"orin"}`, derived from the
  program's effects (`orin effects`). It describes what the program needs; Orbit grants nothing because of it.

## What works, and what does not

| Feature | On `wasm64-orbit` and `wasm32-orbit` |
|---|---|
| the language, std collections, strings, floats, closures, generics, traps | as native (the conformance suites pass as modules) |
| `console.log`, stderr | one log record per line (stdout = info, stderr = error) |
| time (`std:time`, clocks) | `orbit:clock/v1`; the host may coarsen it |
| `process.args` | `["main"]`; no environment; stdin is empty |
| `std:fs`, `std:net`, process spawning | not available: the build fails with E0523 naming the effect and where it comes from |
| `std:task`, channels, `.parallel()` | wasm32: real threads (shared memory, `thread/v1`); wasm64: one task at a time, to completion (see below) |

## Tasks and channels

**wasm32-orbit has real threads** (ADR-0055, decision 9; the wasi-threads model). `std:task`, channels, scopes and `.parallel()`
behave as natively: tasks run at the same time, ping-pong and pipelines over bounded channels work, and a task that traps
reaches its join. The module imports its memory as shared memory (`env.memory`, maximum 65536 pages = 4 GiB; the host may
give less) and `orbit:thread/v1 spawn(arg: i64) -> i64`; the host starts the same module again on the same memory in a new
OS thread and calls the export `orin_thread_start(tid: i64, arg: i64)`. A trap or `exit` in any thread ends all threads. The
manifest of a program that uses tasks lists `thread/v1` (and `clock/v1`, for timed waits). Costs: a task that traps parks its
OS thread until the module ends (WebAssembly cannot unwind to the thread entry, and a trap would end all threads), so a program
with thousands of trapping tasks needs a host that allows that many threads; each thread has a 1 MiB stack; there is no guard
page below a thread stack; a real deadlock hangs, as natively.

**wasm64-orbit has one thread.** The module runs `std:task` tasks one after the other, each to completion. `spawn`
only queues a task. A queued task runs when someone would otherwise block: `join` of it, or any wait on a channel, scope or
monitor (the waiting task gives the thread to the next queued task and re-checks its condition afterwards); tasks nobody
joined run before `main` ends. So these work as natively: spawn-and-join, `scope`, `.parallel()` (with one core), channels
whose sender never waits for the receiver (the capacity is large enough, or the producer is joined before the consumer
reads), fan-out and fan-in.

Two things do not work there, and both end the module with a line that starts with `wasm64-orbit: ` on stderr instead of
hanging or giving a wrong answer:

- **Interleaving.** A task that waits for something only a task suspended below it can produce (ping-pong over bounded
  channels, a producer that blocks on a full channel while the consumer waits for the next item) cannot be resumed
  without stack switching: `wasm64-orbit: deadlock: ...`, trap, exit status 134.
- **A task that traps.** Natively the trap ends the task and the joiner sees it (`panic reaches join`). WebAssembly cannot
  unwind the task's frames, so the whole module ends: `wasm64-orbit: a task trapped: <message>`, exit status 101.

Because the spawned closure is an unresolved callback to the effect analysis, the manifest of a program that spawns tasks
also lists `clock/v1`. Timed waits do not sleep: with nothing queued a timed wait returns as timed out at once, so a program that waits for a
deadline sees it early. How it is built (ADR-0055, decision 4): the runtime keeps per-task state in `__thread` objects; the
build turns each into an ordinary object of the section `orin_tls` (`-D__thread=__attribute__((section("orin_tls")))`), so
they form one block, and the L0 saves that block, installs its pristine image, runs the task and restores the block. No
atomics or WebAssembly threads are involved.

## wasm32-orbit or wasm64-orbit?

Same language and behaviour; the width of the C pointers differs, and only wasm32 has threads (a task program imports `thread/v1` and a shared memory there). In `wasm32-orbit`
Orin values stay 64-bit (`usize`, `int`, every slot), so arithmetic and memory per object are the same as on wasm64; only
addresses are 4 bytes. Choose by where the module runs:

- **wasm32-orbit** is the target with real threads and runs everywhere (every engine and every Orbit version) and avoids the bounds-check cost of Memory64
  (ADR-0055 "Measurements" has the numbers). Limits: the memory is at most 4 GiB (an allocation that does not fit fails with
  `out of memory`, a size above 4 GiB traps with the same message, never wraps), and the module's own 1 MiB stack and data
  count against that.
- **wasm64-orbit** has no 4 GiB limit but needs an engine with Memory64 (Node >= 24, Wasmtime, Orbit).

The host contract is identical: every pointer and length that crosses the Orbit ABI is an `i64`, zero-extended for the 32-bit memory.

## Testing

`tools/test_wasm.sh` runs the conformance suites as WebAssembly modules (once per width) under Node >= 24 (`tools/wasm_run.mjs` serves log, clock and thread with Orbit's load-time checks; threads are worker_threads on one shared memory), plus the differential tests of the WebAssembly L0 and its size budget. One
suite only: `NODE=node python3 tools/run_tests.py --orinc build/bootstrap/orin2 --target wasm64-orbit --suite all` (or `--target wasm32-orbit`).
