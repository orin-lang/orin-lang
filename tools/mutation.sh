# The mutation checks (tooling/mutation, an Orin package): builds it when needed and runs it. It replaces
# `python3 tools/mutate_std.py` and `python3 tools/mutate_ox.py` in CI and in the tools; the flags are the same, after the
# name of the check:
#
#   tools/mutation.sh std [--orinc COMPILER] [--module bytes|utf8|collections|http|net|text|html|task] [--list]
#                         [--shard I/N] [-j N]
#   tools/mutation.sh ox  [--orinc COMPILER] [--cc CC] [--list] [--only NAME[,NAME]] [-j N]
#   tools/mutation.sh --build-only        build build/mutation/orin-mutation and stop
#   tools/mutation.sh --unit-tests        run the @Test unit tests of the package (tooling/mutation/tests)
#
# The checks are compiled by a trusted, already built compiler: $ORIN_MUTATION_BUILDER, else build/bootstrap/orin2, else
# build/dev/orin. It is never compiled by the compiler under test (--orinc), so a broken compiler cannot also break its judge.
# The build is skipped when the compiler, the package sources, the runtime and the platform layer are unchanged
# (build/mutation/stamp). `ox` runs the OX conformance tests of each mutated compiler with tools/conformance.sh, which is
# built first. docs/testing.md, "Mutation checks".
