# Concurrency stage 0 (ADR-0017): the C parts and the Orin stress tests under the sanitizers.
#   1. runtime/core/tests/task_test.c (transfer by move / copy, task start / join / trap, monitors, grants moved into a task):
#      plain, ThreadSanitizer, and AddressSanitizer + UBSan;
#   2. every tests/concurrency/*.or (thousands of tasks, tens of thousands of messages), compiled by the self-hosted compiler
#      and run plain, under ThreadSanitizer and under ASan + UBSan; the output must equal the .out file and the plain run must
#      leave no live object at exit (ORIN_STATS=1: allocations and frees of all tasks cancel out). A program whose first line is
#      `// exit: N` is a panic test: it must end with status N and a `task panicked` message (no hang, race or crash on the way).
# The platform layer has its own ThreadSanitizer run (tools/verify_platform.sh). Needs the compiler (tools/bootstrap.sh).
#   tools/test_concurrency.sh [--quick]     --quick: only the plain and ThreadSanitizer builds of the Orin tests
# Honest limit: ThreadSanitizer finds the races that HAPPEN in these runs; a clean run is evidence, not a proof (the C
# parts are TESTED_ONLY until R3/R4, docs/concurrency.md "Assurance").
