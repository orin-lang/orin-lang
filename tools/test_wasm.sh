# The wasm64-orbit target (ADR-0055) in one command, as CI runs it:
#   1. the float formatting / parsing of the WebAssembly L0 against glibc (tools/test_wasm_float.sh);
#   2. its compiler support routines (orin_builtins_orbit.c) against the native __int128 arithmetic and libm round;
#   3. the conformance suites built as WebAssembly modules and run under Node with the Orbit import contract
#      (tools/run_tests.py --target wasm64-orbit, tools/wasm_run.mjs); a test needing an effect the target lacks is SKIP,
#      and so is a test whose tasks need to run at the same time or trap (the L0 ends the module with a `wasm64-orbit: <reason>` line);
#   4. the size budget of runtime/platform/orbit (900 code lines).
