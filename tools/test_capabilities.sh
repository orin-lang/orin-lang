# Capability grants (ADR-0021 Stage A, ADR-0027): behaviour the conformance runner cannot set up because it needs
# an environment variable (the host policy ORIN_DENY), stdin or an exit status check.
#   1. control run: nothing denied, every family works;
#   2. ORIN_DENY=<family>: an operation that returns a Result reports Err("... denied by the host policy"), every
#      other operation traps with exit status 101 and the "capability denied" message, and the command never runs;
#   3. a malformed ORIN_DENY (typo, space, empty element, upper case) traps at start: a typo never silently allows;
#   4. both backends (C and, when clang is available, LLVM).
