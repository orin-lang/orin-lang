# The allocator, destroy, make_unique, the monitor operations, transfer, lend, the task functions and the heap retire of runtime/core are
# Orin functions (runtime/core/*.or); the code a program is compiled to defines their C names for the C shells. The unit tests of the runtime
# (runtime/core/tests/*.c) link only C files, so they link this object too: tools/rt_stub.or compiled to C by the self-hosted compiler
# ($ORIN2, default build/bootstrap/orin2) with `main` renamed and `--rt-wrappers` (ADR-0052 Addendum B section 3: the wrappers under the
# former C names orin_mon_* and orin_rt_* of the task interface, which normal programs do not carry; the live runtime has no C definition of
# them since R3e.6). CFLAGS (the sanitizer flags of the test) are used for the stub as well. Prints OUT.o.
