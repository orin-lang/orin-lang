# Frozen runtime snapshot (the "legacy world")

A byte copy of `runtime/core/orin_runtime.{c,h}`, `orin_runtime_io.h`, `orin_runtime_mir.h` and `orin_runtime_llvm.c` as they were
at the start of ADR-0052 step R3d (commit 4d5eeee), with the C object model (`orin_struct_new`, `orin_destroy`, the free lists, ...)
and the C copies of the R1/R3b string functions. **Do not edit it.**

It is linked by

- `tools/bootstrap.sh` for stage 0 and stage 1: `seed.c` and `stage1.c` are emitted by compilers whose logic predates R3d, and the
  live runtime is free to lose the definitions they reference (R3d.1 and later) before the seed is regenerated (R3d.7);
- the `--c-builtins` side of `tools/differential.sh --mode builtins` (the legacy world: the C runtime path, no `$std` / `$rt`).

The files that link it read the list in `tools/runtime-sources.txt` (world `legacy`). The platform layer (`runtime/platform/`) is
shared with the live runtime. Deletion order: ADR-0052 Addendum A section 4 (R3d.7 refreshes the seed, R3f removes this directory).

**Additive exceptions.** New runtime entry points that std modules call on every program path must also exist here, or the
legacy world cannot link those programs. They are appended verbatim from `runtime/core/` and change nothing that existed at the
snapshot: `orin_rt_task_watch` and `orin_mon_wait_until` (ADR-0017 Addendum B, C1; the `done_mon` field of `RtTask`).

**ADR-0048 exception (std:fs).** `orin_fs_exists` returns a negative denial code instead of trapping and `orin_fs_list_dir`
returns `Result<string[],string>` (the same two edits as `runtime/core/`), because the seed is the compiler compiled with the
migrated `std:fs` and its stage 0 and stage 1 link this snapshot. The C4 entry points `orin_fs_rename`, `orin_fs_remove_file`, `orin_fs_remove_dir`
and `orin_fs_write_file_atomic` (with their helper `fs_check_entry`) are appended verbatim for the same reason.
